## Architecture overview


## Coding Rule

### Git commit messages

Conventional Commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Allowed types:
`feat`, `fix`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`, `style`, `docs`, `perf`, `build`, `ci`, `revert`.

### Versioning

The project follows a **minor-bump-only** versioning scheme (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`):

- **Patch** version is always `0`. Never bump it.
- **Minor** version is bumped for any change: new features, improvements, bug fixes, etc.
- **Major** version is only changed by explicit manual decision; it stays unchanged during
  normal development.

Examples: `0.68.0` → `0.69.0` → `0.70.0`; never `0.68.1`.

This rule applies to all packages in the repo (root, `packages/*`, `sdks/*`) as well as release
and skill workflows.

### Release workflow

1. Ensure `main` is up to date (pull latest).
2. Create a release branch, e.g. `bump-0.68` or `bump-pykaos-0.5.3`.
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md`: rename `[Unreleased]` to `[0.68] - YYYY-MM-DD`.
4. Update `pyproject.toml` version.
5. Run `uv sync` to align `uv.lock`.
6. Commit the branch and open a PR.
7. Merge the PR, then switch back to `main` and pull latest.
8. Tag and push:
   - `git tag 0.68` or `git tag pykaos-0.5.3`
   - `git push --tags`
9. GitHub Actions handles the release after tags are pushed.
